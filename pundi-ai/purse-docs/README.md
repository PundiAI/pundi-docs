# PURSE+ (browser plugin)

PURSE+ SocialAI is an innovative browser plugin that seamlessly integrates SocialFi (Social Finance) and Artificial Intelligence, empowering users to contribute to AI development through social media engagement.&#x20;

As the first of its kind, PURSE+ SocialAI enables participants to analyze, tag, and categorize social data on platforms like X.com (formerly Twitter), earning rewards in the form of FUGU points, which can be converted into tokens for real-world use.&#x20;

Developed by Pundi X, PURSE+ SocialAI is designed to democratize AI by allowing anyone, regardless of technical expertise, to participate in and benefit from the growth of AI technology. It is part of the broader Pundi AIFX initiative, which focuses on enhancing AI capabilities through community-driven efforts, creating a unique and valuable ecosystem for all users.
