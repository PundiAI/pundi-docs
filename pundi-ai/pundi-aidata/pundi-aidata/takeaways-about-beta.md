## Outline Workflow

1. Add a dataset

Dataset is the foundation of a labeling task. It is required to add at least one dataset to get started. Pundi AIData Beta supports text and image data.

2. Create a labeling task

On Pundi AIData Beta, to create a task, the Task Owner is required to provide token rewards in $USDT with the task. This is designed to prevent spam and award data processors. The minimum amount of provided $USDT is allowed to be 0.&#x20;

Once created, all active tasks will be presented with total reward and an estimated hourly earning. Hourly earning =  Task reward / number of data rows \* 1200. (3 seconds to label a data row) &#x20;

3. Contribute to the labeling work

Once a labeling task is created, it is accessible to all users on Pundi AIData Beta. Everyone is allowed to contribute to the labeling work for any task of in progress status.&#x20;

The final earning of each labeler is decided by the number of valid labeled data rows they have done.

4. Receive the task rewards

When the labeling work of this task is all done, task reward will be settled and distributed to labelers’ wallet addresses by smart contrat.

5. <mark style="color:red;">Download the labeled data (not available in beta)</mark>
