    * Rationale: Encourages efficient task posting while rewarding the protocol for maintaining the infrastructure and facilitating task execution.
* Pundi AIFX Omni Layer
  * Validator Block Reward
    * As the governance tokens, staking`$PUNDIAI`allows users to earn block rewards, as of Dec 2024 the apr is \~15%. Details on delegation can be found on [support](https://support.functionx.io/hc/en-us/articles/900004371166-How-to-delegate-FX-to-a-validator).

  * Bribe Fee
    * Bribe for`$vePUNDIAI`Holders: When projects aim to incentivize`$vePUNDIAI`holders to vote for liquidity incentives, the platform takes 10% of the project's incentive tokens,  and goes to [protocol pool](protocol-pool.md).
    * Rationale: Aligns`$vePUNDIAI`governance with project incentives, encouraging participation while generating revenue for the protocol.
  * Transaction Fee (Bonding Curve)
    * 1% Fee Per Transaction: Any transaction using the bonding curve incurs a 1% fee, and goes to [protocol pool](protocol-pool.md).
    * Rationale: Provides sustainable revenue tied to token trading activity, supporting liquidity dynamics and the ecosystem.
  * LP Fee
    * Fee from Liquidity Pool Transactions: After`$vePUNDIAI`holders vote for liquidity incentives, the protocol uses half of the funds to buy project tokens and pair them with half $FX creating a 50/50 pool. The foundation earns ongoing fees from LP transactions, and goes to [protocol pool](protocol-pool.md).
    * Rationale: Aligns protocol interests with project success while fostering long-term liquidity and earning transaction fees.
  * Convincing Fee
    * Fee to Convince Pundi Fun AI Agent Launcher : Developers must pay a fee to request their token (or pool) be whitelisted for liquidity incentives. 10% of the fee goes to `$vePUNDIAI` holders  through the [protocol pool](protocol-pool.md)..
    * Rationale: Ensures only serious proposals while directly rewarding governance participants.
