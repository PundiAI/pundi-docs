# ðŸ¥‡ Token: $PUNDIAI

Pundi AI uses two tokens to manage its utility and governance:

* `$PUNDIAI` â€” ERC-20 utility and governance token of the protocol for [Pundi AI Data Platform](../pundi-aidata/), [Pundi AI Marketplace](../pundi-ai-data-marketplace-soon.md), [Pundi AIFX Omni Layer](../pundi-aifx/) and [Pundi Fun AI Agent Launcher](../pundi-fun-ai-agent-launcher-proposal/).
* `$vePUNDIAI` â€” ERC-721 a form of locked $PUNDIAI in an NFT (non-fungible token) specifically for epoch voting in [Pundi Fun AI Agent Launcher](../pundi-fun-ai-agent-launcher-proposal/), playing a specific governance role for epoch incentives.&#x20;
  * Any `$PUNDIAI` holder that have delegated their tokens to a validator can vote-escrow their delegation proof and receive a `$vePUNDIAI` (also known as Lock or veNFT) in exchange.

`$PUNDIAI` is a redenomination from[`$FX`](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/function-x). Redenomination is scheduled across major exchanges and on-chain in Q1 2025. There is an active discussion on [Pundiscan forum](https://forum.pundi.ai/t/temperature-check-upgrade-f-x-core-and-rebrand-function-x-to-pundi-aifx/).
