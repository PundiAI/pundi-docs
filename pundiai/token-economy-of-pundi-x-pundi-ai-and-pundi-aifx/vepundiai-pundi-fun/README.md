# vePUNDIAI (Pundi Fun)

The `$vePUNDIAI`(vote-escrowed $PUNDI) model is designed for [Pundi Fun AI Agent Launcher](../../pundi-fun-ai-agent-launcher-proposal/) to create long-term value, sustainability, and alignment within the Pundi AI ecosystem by incentivizing holders to lock tokens, participate in governance, and support AI agent development and liquidity.&#x20;

This approach combines mechanics from Pump.fun's AI agent launches with [Aerodromeâ€™s ve3,3](https://aerodrome.finance/docs#tokenomics) voting model, ensuring incentives are prolonged and self-reinforcing. The lock period (also known as vote-escrowed period, hence the _ve_ prefix) can be up to 4 years, following the linear relationship shown below:

* 100 `$PUNDIAI` locked for 4 years will become`$vePUNDIAI with 100 weight.`
* 100 `$PUNDI` locked for 1 year will become`$vePUNDIAI with 25 weight.`
* `100 $PUNDI locked for 1 day will become $vePUNDI with` 0.068493150684932 `weight`.

Users can create `$vePUNDIAI` only after [delegating`$PUNDIAI`tokens](https://support.functionx.io/hc/en-us/articles/900004371166-How-to-delegate-FX-to-a-validator).
