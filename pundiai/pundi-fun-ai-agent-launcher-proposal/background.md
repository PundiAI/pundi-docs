description: Why AI Agents Should Be Treated as Public Goods
---

# Background

**\*this is a proposal and is not tabled for implementation yet, for latest discussion, please head to Pundiscan forum.\***

In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to revolutionize how we work, learn, communicate, and solve some of the world’s most pressing challenges. However, to unlock the full potential of AI, it must be accessible to everyone—not just to those who can afford to develop or purchase expensive AI tools. The idea of treating AI agents as public goods is a crucial step in making AI a force for good, benefiting all of humanity, rather than a privileged few.

AI agents, like other public goods, share two defining characteristics: they are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. This means that once created, they can be accessed and used by anyone, and one person’s use of the technology does not reduce its availability to others. In practice, this means that AI agents, when treated as public goods, can be shared and improved by individuals, organizations, and communities across the globe, contributing to a more innovative, equitable, and sustainable future.

When AI agents are treated as public goods, they become a collective resource that everyone can access and contribute to. This openness creates a powerful feedback loop of innovation: as more people use and improve AI agents, the technology becomes more robust, intelligent, and effective, creating a virtuous cycle that benefits all. Public goods have a track record of fostering collaboration, as seen in the success of open-source software. Just as the world benefited from the collective advancements of open-source platforms like Linux and Apache, so too can AI agents serve as a catalyst for collective progress.
