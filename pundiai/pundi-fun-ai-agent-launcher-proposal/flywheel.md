Step 1: Projects pay datasets and data labellers on Pundi AI Data Platform to train their agents. Optionally projects can also launch with their own AI agents design without using Pundi AI Data Platform for training but directly launching on Pundi Fun AI Agent Launcher

Step 2:  At the same time, project will launch their DAO tokens on Pundi AI Agent LAuncher,  if demand for the DAO tokens exceeds $65,000 FDV, the liquidity will be injected into open market such as Aerodrome. The liquidity is paired with $FX so it will be $TOKEN/$PUNDIAI creating a demand for $PUNDIAI tokens.

Step 3: Once the liquidity is in the open market such as Aerodrome, projects participates in weekly epoch incentives to further grow their DAO token by bribing vePUNDIAI holders for votes.

* Projects bribes veFX holders via their project tokens or other tokens such as $PUNDIAI to encourage veFX holders to vote for their projects. In exchange vePUNDIAI holders receive these bribe tokens as rewards.&#x20;
* As eward to the project for bribing, Pundi AI foundation will provide liquidity into Aerodrome by buying up AI agent tokens and paired with $FX as liquidity. Eg: if a project receives $1000 worth of $FX after each weekly epoch bribe, half of the $1000 will be used to buy the tokens and the $TOKEN/$PUNDIAI liquidity will be injected into open market.
* The flywheel allows&#x20;
  * projects to bootstrap their tokens
  * Pundi AI to grow $PUNDIAI token's demand
  * vePUNDIAI holders to get project tokens by participating weekly in voting.
