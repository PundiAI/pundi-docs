Step 1 & 2 is [training and launching AI Agent](train-and-launch-step-1-and-2.md), and getting the DAO tokens to reach bonding curve.&#x20;

Step 3: Once the liquidity is in the open market such as Aerodrome, projects participates in weekly epoch incentives to further grow their DAO token by bribing `$vePUNDIAI` holders for votes.

* Projects bribes[ `$vePUNDIAI`](../token-economy-of-pundi-x-pundi-ai-and-pundi-aifx/vepundiai-pundi-fun/) holders via their project tokens or other tokens to encourage $vePUNDIAI holders to vote for their projects. In exchange `$vePUNDIAI` holders receive these bribe tokens as rewards.&#x20;
* As eward to the project for bribing, Pundi AI foundation will provide liquidity into Aerodrome by buying up AI agent tokens and paired with `$PUNDIAI` as liquidity. Eg: if a project receives $1000 worth of $PUNDIAI after each weekly epoch bribe, half of the $1000 will be used to buy the tokens and the `$TOKEN/$PUNDIAI` liquidity will be injected into open market.

There is a [vePUNDIAI how-to bribe section](../token-economy-of-pundi-x-pundi-ai-and-pundi-aifx/vepundiai-pundi-fun/how-to-bribe-with-vepundiai.md) for a more visualised steps.
