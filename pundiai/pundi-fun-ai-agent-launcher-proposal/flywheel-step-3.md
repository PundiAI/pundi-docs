Step 1 & 2 is [training and launching AI Agent](train-and-launch-step-1-and-2.md), and getting the DAO tokens to reach bonding curve.&#x20;

Step 3: Once the liquidity is in the open market such as Aerodrome, projects participates in weekly epoch incentives to further grow their DAO token by bribing vePUNDIAI holders for votes.

* Projects bribes[ vePUNDIAI](../token-economy-of-pundi-x-pundi-ai-and-pundi-aifx/vepundiai.md) holders via their project tokens or other tokens to encourage vePUNDIAI holders to vote for their projects. In exchange vePUNDIAI holders receive these bribe tokens as rewards.&#x20;
* As eward to the project for bribing, Pundi AI foundation will provide liquidity into Aerodrome by buying up AI agent tokens and paired with $PUNDIAI as liquidity. Eg: if a project receives $1000 worth of $PUNDIAI after each weekly epoch bribe, half of the $1000 will be used to buy the tokens and the $TOKEN/$PUNDIAI liquidity will be injected into open market.
* The flywheel allows&#x20;
  * projects to bootstrap their tokens
  * Pundi AI to grow $PUNDIAI token's demand
  * vePUNDIAI holders to get project tokens by participating weekly in voting.



Note: $FX is redenominated to $PUNDIAI in 2025, some articles might be using this two tokens interchangbly.
