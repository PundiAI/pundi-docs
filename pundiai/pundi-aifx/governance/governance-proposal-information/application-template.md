# Application Template

### Overview

At this stage, it is paramount the proposer provides as many details as possible so the team can provide better guidance and support. However, this can also just be the start of a conversation, so don’t lose sleep over this!

After your inquiry is submitted, the team will get in touch within 3-5 business days to get the conversation started. From there, the team will answer any questions you might have and ask you for more info if needed.

#### Details:

{% hint style="info" %}
_The combination of your GitHub account submitting the application and the payment address below together with your governance proposal number will be your unique identifier during the program. Please keep them safe._

{% hint style="info" %}
Showcasing past projects and your team's track record will definitely help in your proposal's chances of being successful. Additionally, the more details about your project the better, especially with regards to the research you have made and the careful planning of your project.
{% endhint %}

### **Ecosystem Fit/Impact**

As an organization, the team will focus on doing what's best for Function X. So, it is important you describe how your work will benefit the Function X ecosystem.

#### **Details:**

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
* What problem are you solving?
* Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
* Who will benefit, and how: what tools or opportunities will people have that they didn't have before? What will be possible that wasn't possible before? Do you have anything tangible to give back to the community like airdrops?
* What need(s) does your project meet?
* Are there any other projects similar to yours in other EVM/Cosmos ecosystem?
  * If so, how is your project different?
  * If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

{% hint style="info" %}
Having tangibles to give back to the community will certainly help with the success of your proposal.
{% endhint %}

### **Development status**

If you've already started implementing your project or if it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying.

#### Details:

* Academic publications relevant to the problem
* Links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues
* References to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation
* Previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes
* What are the most significant obstacles facing your project or your team right now?
  * Difficulty finding support or community
  * Technical dilemmas
* What are some of your most pressing needs?
  * Feedback and direction
  * Collaborations or connections with other teams, mentors, advisors

> ⚠️ At the inquiry stage, you will only need to fill the template up to this part. Development status will help us understand your needs better and help us provide better assistance to you beyond financial support.

### **Associated costs**

This segment is to show all the costs your project requires including any research of how you arrived at those costs, including any assumptions made.

#### Details:

* Is the budget plan reasonable?
* How do you plan on using the fund?
* Clear breakdown of associated costs?
  * If you are spending funds on hiring developers, you can state their qualifications and how much you expect to pay them.
  * You can also mention the server costs and other miscellaneous costs associated with the project.
* If you intend to redistribute part or total of the requested funds in any manner, please specify how you intend to do it, and how community funds will serve the general FunctionX purpose and not a specific purpose.

{% hint style="info" %}
Detailed research on associated costs and any assumptions on how you arrived at that figure will definitely help your proposal.
{% endhint %}

### **Development Roadmap**

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below, we provide an example roadmap. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Function X. We recommend that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone:

* Make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
* Include the amount of funding requested per milestone.
* Include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* Commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
* Indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
* Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> **If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish under the terms of the license of the respective project and that you highlight this fact in your milestone documentation and in the source code if applicable! Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

#### **Overview**

* Total Estimated Duration: Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
* Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time\_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
* Total Costs: Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the level of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in FX, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.

**Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules**

* Estimated duration: 1 month
* FTE: 2
* Costs: 8,000 USD
