# Pundi AIFX (omnichain layer)

Pundi AIFX is part of the Pundi AI ecosystem, it is an omnichain decentralized AI data processing layer that was formerly known as Function X (FX).

As a ominichain data layer, it powers the Pundi AI suites of services by processing the transactions and smart contracts. Pundi AIFX is built using Cosmos SDK application with further modification including high performant and omnichain support of various EVM and Cosmos compatible blockchains.

It abstracts away (hides) the complexities of Pundi AI by allowing users to focus on the usage rather than the complexities under the hood. Projects and users on these mainnets can access the full suite of Pundi AI suite of tools without needing to engage in cross-chain operations. They can participate as content contributors by uploading and tagging content, or as content users browsing and downloading AI training data, all while remaining within their familiar mainnet environment. Developers can also engage in these activities and interact with the system through their preferred mainnet interfaces.
