# Manual Upgrade Guide v7.5.x

{% hint style="warning" %}
❗️Please note that the current fxCore Mainnet v7.5.x upgrade, the upgrade height is 16,838,000, and the upgrade countdown is [**Countdown Timer**](https://pundiscan.io/fxcore/block/countdown/16838000?chainId=fxcore).
{% endhint %}

Here is the guide to manually upgrade `fxcored`, If you are running a validator node, we recommend integrating [cosmovisor](../cosmovisor/) , Cosmovisor can help validators automatically complete node upgrades when they reach the upgrade height, improving the operating efficiency of nodes.
