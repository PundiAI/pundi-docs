### Viewing your wallet balances

* You may view your balance on f(x)wallet which also allows for a more seamless way of transaction. You may download f(x)wallet from the Appstore or Google Play [here](https://download.functionx.io).
* Once downloaded, enter into the settings configuration, (the button is on the top right, there is a settings icon)
  * Under general/Network Configuration, ensure your f(x)Core is toggled to `Testnet`
* You may view your FX balance from the f(x) Wallet or the [Function X Testnet Explorer](https://dhobyghaut-explorer.functionx.io/)/[Function X Mainnet Explorer](https://explorer.functionx.io/).
* Alternatively, to `query` your validator account balance (token holding account):

```bash
fxcored q bank balances <token holding account public address>
```
