# Pundi AI

Pundi AI is created in 2024 by [Pundi X](https://www.pundix.com).

Pundi AI democratizes artificial intelligence development through a decentralized suite of tools. It offers services ranging from an omnichain data layer, data tagging and annotation platform to an AI marketplace for trading of data.

Pundi AI suite of tools:

* Pundi AI Data platform
* Pundi AIFX omnichain layer
* PURSE+ browser plugin
* (coming soon) Pundi AI Data Marketplace
* (coming soon) Pundi Fun AI agent launcher

The [Pundi AI Data](pundiai/pundi-aidata/) platform provides professional data, labeling and annotation services, ensuring AI data remains open and accessible to all. Decentralized users can participate in tag-and-earn of data and contribute to the advancement of AI.

Powered by the [Pundi AIFX](pundiai/pundi-aifx/) omni layer, activities are securely recorded on-chain and integrated with IPFS and various blockchains, abstracting away data and smart contract completixities while allowing users to interact on chains like Base. With [PURSE+](pundiai/purse-docs/) browser plugin on x.com, users can actively contribute by tagging and annotating data for social AI, fostering a more participatory ecosystem.

In 2025, an [Pundi AI Data Marketplace](pundiai/pundi-ai-data-marketplace-soon.md) will be launched for trading untrained and trained datasets, including but not limited to those form Pundi AI Data platform. [Pundi Fun AI Agent Launcher](pundiai/pundi-fun-ai-agent-launcher-proposal/) will also be launched in 2025, allowing the training of agentic AI agents using datasets on Pundi AI Data platform and launching agents and their DAO tokens on-chain.
