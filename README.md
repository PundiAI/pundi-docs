# Pundi AI

Pundi AI is created in 2024 by [Pundi X](readme/purse-docs/ibc/pundix-chain.md).

Pundi AI democratizes artificial intelligence development through a decentralized suite of tools. It offers services ranging from an omnichain data layer, data tagging and annotation platform to an AI marketplace for trading of data.

Pundi AI suite of tools:

* Pundi AI Data platform
* Pundi AIFX omnichain layer
* PURSE+ browser plugin
* (coming soon) Pundi AI Data Marketplace.

The [Pundi AI Data](readme/pundi-aidata/) platform provides professional data, labeling and annotation services, ensuring AI data remains open and accessible to all. Decentralized users can participate in tag-and-earn of data and contribute to the advancement of AI.

Powered by the [Pundi AIFX](readme/pundi-aifx/) omnichain layer, activities are securely recorded on-chain and integrated with IPFS and various blockchains, paving the way for a decentralized data exchange. With [PURSE+](readme/purse-docs/) browser plugin on x.com, users can actively contribute by tagging and annotating data for social AI, fostering a more participatory ecosystem.

This infrastructure ensures AI development remains transparent and resistant to monopolistic control, allowing broader participation and innovation across the industry. Pundi AI's mission is to create an open AI ecosystem where data and development are accessible to everyone.
