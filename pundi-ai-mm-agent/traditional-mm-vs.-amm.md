# Traditional MM vs. AMM

#### **Traditional Market Makers (MM):**

Traditional MMs provide liquidity by actively quoting buy and sell prices, dynamically adapting to market conditions. Their advantages include:

* **Customizable Strategies**: React to market trends, news, and events.
* **Active Risk Management**: Minimize exposure to volatility and inventory risks.
* **Higher Efficiency in Volatility**: Ensure tighter spreads and deep liquidity.
* **Arbitrage Opportunities**: Capture inter-market discrepancies.

However, traditional MMs are centralized, resource-intensive, and less accessible to the broader community. According to a report by Citadel Securities, traditional MMs accounted for over 40% of U.S. equity trading volume in 2021, highlighting their dominance in centralized markets ([source](https://www.citadelsecurities.com)).

#### **Automated Market Makers (AMM):**

AMMs operate on decentralized protocols, using mathematical formulas to facilitate trades. Advantages include:

* **Decentralization**: No intermediaries.
* **Accessibility**: Anyone can provide liquidity.
* **Simplicity**: Straightforward algorithms for operation.

Challenges of AMMs include:

* **Capital Inefficiency**: Requires excessive liquidity to reduce slippage. For example, studies show that Uniswap v3 LPs often provide liquidity with only a 50% utilization rate (source).
* **Rigid Pricing Models**: Unable to adapt to volatility.
* **Impermanent Loss**: LPs suffer losses when prices deviate. Research indicates that up to 80% of Uniswap LPs experience negative returns due to impermanent loss ([source](https://www.paradigm.xyz)).
* **Poor Volatility Handling**: Struggle in highly dynamic markets.
