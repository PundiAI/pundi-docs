*   Step 1: Projects trains AI agents through Pundi AI Data Platform.&#x20;

    * Projects pay datasets owners and data labelers. Optionally projects can also launch with their own AI agents design without using Pundi AI Data Platform for training. They directly launch their DAO tokens on Pundi Fun. Projects launch their DAO tokens on Pundi Fun by seeding 100% of their tokens into the pool.


*   Step 2: Projects grows and DAO token reaches bonding curve

    * If demand for the DAO tokens exceeds $65,000 FDV, the liquidity will be injected into open market such as Aerodrome. The liquidity is paired with `$PUNDIAI`. This allows Pundi AI team to help support liquidity in Step 3, the flywheel.


* Step 3: is the [flywheel](flywheel-step-3.md).
