# Why Market Making

The crypto world moves faster than a FOMO-driven ape minting NFTs. We’ve seen waves from L1s and L2s to memes, AI agents, DeSci, and whatever meta is next. But one thing never changes: the grind. Projects launch tokens (getting easier with tools like Pump.fun), list on CEXs and DEXs, and then scramble to find a market maker to juice liquidity. If you want your token to trade like a champ and not a rug, liquidity is king — and market making is the throne.

Sure, AMMs are cool, but let’s not kid ourselves. They’ve got issues: capital inefficiency, out-of-range LP positions, rebalancing headaches, and zero ability to handle the chaos of volatility. And don’t even think about cross-exchange or cross-chain arbitrage. AMMs weren’t built for that level of degen.

Enter Pundi AI MM Agent, here to run the game. Market making isn’t just about survival — it’s a profit-max machine that keeps your token trading smoothly and legit. With AI-driven strategies, Pundi AI MM Agent doesn’t just drop liquidity into the pool; it optimizes, adapts, and crushes inefficiencies.&#x20;

The result? A win-win flywheel that keeps the liquidity flowing, the trading smooth, and the token pumping.
