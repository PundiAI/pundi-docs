# Overview

Data Pump is a core feature of the Pundi AI ecosystem. It allows dataset owners who hold a valid Access NFT to turn high-quality AI training data into liquid, tradable on-chain assets called Dataset Tokens (DTOKs). Inspired by proven Web3 models like tokenized agent economies (as seen in [Virtuals](https://www.virtuals.io)), Data Pump applies these principles directly to the source of intelligence: high-quality data.

This design ensures that data contributors retain permissionless access, earn fair returns, and deliver transparent utility to AI developers and the broader community.
