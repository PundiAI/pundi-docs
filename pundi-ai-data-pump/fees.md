**Service Fees**\
Launching a project on Data Pump is free. You only pay trading-related fees, and you can begin trading immediately without needing to provide initial liquidity.

**Points Usage**\
No points are consumed during token creation. However, you may set point-based conditions for who can participate in trading your token.

**Launch Fee**\
When a pool’s fundraising target (e.g., 1000 $PUNDIX) is reached, the last user to trigger the launch will cover the gas fee to deploy the token to PancakeSwap.

Estimated cost: ≈ 0.0004 BNB, depending on current mainnet gas.

**Trading Fee**\
Data Pump charges a 1% fee on all trades conducted on the platform.

**Trading Restrictions**\
When creating a token, you can set:

* A minimum Pundi AI Points requirement for wallet participation,
* A maximum purchase cap per wallet address.
