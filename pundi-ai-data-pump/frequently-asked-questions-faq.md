# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1.  **What is Pundi AI Data Pump?**

    Data Pump lets Access NFT holders tokenize AI datasets into Dataset Tokens (DTOKs), raise community support, and create tradeable, on-chain assets tied to data visibility.\

2.  **Who can use Data Pump?**

    Access NFT holders can create and launch DTOKs. Any user can support a dataset by joining the seeding phase without owning an NFT.\

3.  **What is a bonding curve?**

    A bonding curve adjusts token price based on supply and demand. Early buyers pay less, while late buyers pay more. Sellers can exit at any time by selling back to the curve.\

4.  **Do I need coding skills?**

    No. Data Pump is completely no-code. The platform handles all smart contract deployment, bonding curve pricing, and liquidity setup.\

5.  **Why is seeding important?**

    Seeding demonstrates genuine demand for a dataset before launch. It ensures fair distribution, incentivizes early support, and funds the tokenâ€™s initial liquidity.\

6.  **Where will my Dataset Token (DTOK) be traded?**

    After successful completion of the bonding curve during the seeding phase, your Dataset Token (DTOK) will be automatically listed on decentralized exchanges like PancakeSwap. The Pundi AI MM Agent handles the deployment of liquidity and ongoing market-making to ensure stable trading and fair pricing.\

7.  **Are there fees?**

    Yes. Platform fees cover smart contract deployment, bonding curve logic, and liquidity provisioning. Fees are shown transparently during token creation.\

8.  **How do I get support?**

    Refer to the GitBook or join the community forum. Data Pump is intended for experienced users and does not provide one-on-one support.\

9.  **Conclusion**

    Pundi AI Data Pump brings tokenization and on-chain utility to AI datasets. By combining Dataset Tokens (DTOKs), bonding curves, MEV protection, a permissionless seeding model, and a no-code interface, it creates a new kind of data economy: one that is transparent, liquid, and fair.
