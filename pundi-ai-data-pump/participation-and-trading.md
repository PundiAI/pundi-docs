# Participation and Trading

Only users who hold a valid Access NFT can create and launch a Dataset Token (DTOK) on the Pundi AI Data Pump. This includes Ownership NFTs for dataset creators and Buyer NFTs for users who purchase datasets through the marketplace.

Any user can participate in the seeding phase of a DTOK launch without needing to hold an NFT. During seeding, users can contribute $PUNDIAI to purchase tokens at early pricing. Seeding is permissionless and designed to welcome early backers, traders, and community supporters.

Liquidity deployment is automated and handled by the Pundi AI MM Agent. This smart contract ensures consistent pricing, manages supply through bonding curve logic, and protects community liquidity from external manipulation. Token creators and supporters do not need to configure or manage external liquidity pools.

All Dataset Token (DTOK) transactions are recorded on-chain and can be viewed using the BNB Smart Chain Explorer: [https://bscscan.com](https://bscscan.com)
