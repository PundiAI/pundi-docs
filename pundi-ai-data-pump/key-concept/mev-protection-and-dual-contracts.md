# MEV Protection and Dual Contracts

To prevent front-running and protect community-backed liquidity, Data Pump uses a two-phase contract design. In the seeding phase, a dedicated contract handles all purchases and allocations. Only after the seeding ends and liquidity is generated does the tradable token contract activate.

This separation ensures that malicious actors cannot prematurely create liquidity pools on platforms like PancakeSwap. All liquidity events are managed via the official smart contracts, ensuring fair launch conditions and protecting users from MEV (Miner Extractable Value) exploitation.
