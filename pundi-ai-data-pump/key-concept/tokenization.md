# Tokenization

A dataset owner holding a valid Access NFT can create a Dataset Token (DTOK), which is a BEP-20 token representing community interest in the dataset. DTOKs do not provide access or revenue rights. They are launched via community seeding and become tradable on decentralized exchanges such as [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap).

A single dataset can support multiple DTOKs created by different holders of the same Access NFT. Each DTOK may reflect different narratives, memes, or supporter groups, but they point to the same underlying dataset.
