# Seeding and Fair Launch

Each dataset token follows a fair launch structure:

* The Dataset Token (DTOK) creator initiates the token launch, and the system automatically manages pricing, bonding curve thresholds, and liquidity deployment without manual setup
* Early supporters contribute during the seeding phase
* Once the bonding curve threshold is met, the token becomes liquid and tradable on-chain

DTOK creators can set optional eligibility rules for participants. For example, backers may need to hold a minimum amount of Pundi AI Points or spend Points to qualify for seeding access.

Seeding uses a bonding curve model to manage fair pricing and gradual distribution.
