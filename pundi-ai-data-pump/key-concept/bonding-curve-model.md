# Bonding Curve Model

Data Pump uses a fully on-chain bonding curve, to automate token pricing during and after seeding.

A bonding curve is a mathematical formula that sets token prices based on circulating supply. As tokens are purchased and minted, the price increases. This creates an automatic price discovery process that rewards early supporters and reflects real-time demand.

Tokens can be bought or sold at any time directly through a smart contract. Once the bonding curve threshold is reached, a liquidity pool is automatically created on PancakeSwap, allowing the token to be traded on-chain with no manual setup.

Bonding curves help ensure fair token distribution, transparent pricing, and strong alignment between data creators and the supporting community.
