# Pundi AIFX Omnilayer

Pundi AIFX omni layer is part of the Pundi AI ecosystem, it is an omni chain build for decentralized data processing layer, optimized for AI dapps and its data.

As an omni layer, it powers cross chain Pundi AI suites of services by processing the transactions and smart contracts and allowing it to be presented as native dapps of the target chain. Pundi AIFX is built using pBFT consensus with EVM compatibility - further modification includes high performant and omnichain support of various EVM and Cosmos compatible blockchains.

It abstracts away and hide the complexities of Pundi AI by allowing users to focus on the usage rather than the complexities under the hood. Projects and users on these mainnets can access the full suite of Pundi AI suite of tools without needing to engage in cross-chain operations.

Our `focus in 2025 is to service Base ecosystem`. In other words, users on Base will be using our full suites of products as native application, while Pundi AIFX abstracts (hides) the complexities by processing it on Pundi AIFX omni layer.
