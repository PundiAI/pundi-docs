# Manual Upgrade Guide v8.6.x

{% hint style="warning" %}
❗️Please note that the current Pundi AIFX Mainnet v8.5.x upgrade, the upgrade height is `19908000`, and the upgrade countdown is [**Countdown Timer**](https://pundiscan.io/pundiaifx/block/countdown/19908000).
{% endhint %}

Here is the guide to manually upgrade `fxcored`, If you are running a validator node, we recommend integrating [cosmovisor](../cosmovisor/) , Cosmovisor can help validators automatically complete node upgrades when they reach the upgrade height, improving the operating efficiency of nodes.
