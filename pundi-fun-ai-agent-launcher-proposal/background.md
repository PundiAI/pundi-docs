description: Why AI Agents Should Be Treated as Public Goods
---

# Background

The idea of treating AI agents as public goods is a crucial step in making AI a force for good, benefiting all of humanity, rather than a privileged few.

When AI agents are treated as public goods, they become a collective resource that everyone can access and contribute to. In Pundi Fun AI Agent Launcher, projects are able to launch AI Agents or AI memes through the help of datasets trained on [Pundi AI Data Platform](../pundi-aidata/) and launching the DAO tokens of AI Agents through Pundi Fun AI Agent Launcher, through the launcher, projects can[ launch and train](train-and-launch-step-1-and-2.md) and create a flywheel so that they continue to get liquidity for their DAO tokens from support of Pundi AI's team, in return the projects shares their DAO tokens to our community via weekly epoch bribes, this create a [flywheel](flywheel-step-3.md) that is win-win.
