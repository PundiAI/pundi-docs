# FAQs

**Dataset Access vs. Ownership**

* Access gives the right to use the dataset and also allows the user to create DTOKs (Dataset Tokens) on Data Pump.
* Ownership includes full control of the dataset NFT, which allows the holder to tokenize, resell, and collect revenue from dataset sales.\


**What are Access NFTs?**\
A type of token that represents rights to a dataset. When you buy a dataset, you’re issued an NFT that proves your access.\


**Token Costs and Transactions**\
Accepted tokens depend on the dataset owner’s listed price. Some datasets may be priced in $PUNDIAI, USDT, or $BNB (also required for transaction fees).
