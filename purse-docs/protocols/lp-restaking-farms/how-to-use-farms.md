# How to Use Farms

Yield farming on LP Restaking Farm is a great way to earn PURSE rewards.

Users are required to stake a **cryptocurrency pair** to a liquidity pool (E.g. PURSE and USDT on PancakeSwap) to get LP Token. The LP Token can then be staked in LP Restaking Farm to earn PURSE rewards while still keeping your cryptocurrency pair position!&#x20;

> _Note that each Farm can only accept a specific LP Token._ &#x20;
>
> _For example, PURSE-USDT Farm only accept PURSE-USDT LP Token._
>
> _You have to provide liquidity for that cryptocurrency pair in order to get that specific LP Token._

Yield farming can earn good PURSE rewards, but it comes with a risk of **Impermanent Loss**. It’s not as scary as it sounds and it is worth learning about the concept before you get started.

### Getting Prepared

It takes a little work before the yield farming starts.

It may sound intimidating but it's not too complicated.&#x20;

Let's go it through step by step!

### Choosing your Farm <a href="#finding-your-farm" id="finding-your-farm"></a>

Before you proceed, you may want to choose a farm that's right for you. Visit [LP Restaking Farm](https://pursetoken.com/lpfarm/menu) and you will see a list of available farms.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that the PURSE-BUSD Farm has been deprecated. Please use the PURSE-USDT Farm instead. The steps to interact with the PURSE-USDT Farm are exactly the same as you would interact with the PURSE-BUSD Farm.
{% endhint %}

### Providing Liquidity to get LP Token

Now that you have chosen a farm, you will need to provide liquidity to the liquidity pool in order to get LP Token.

1. Click _Select_ on the farm you have chosen from the list.

3\. This will direct users to the respective liquidity page according to the chosen farm. If the cryptocurrency pair is correct, click _Add Liquidity_ to proceed.

4\. If you do not have liquidity for either one of the tokens, you will not be able enter the amount and the _Supply_ button will be disabled.

> _Add liquidity for BUSD and/or PURSE before you proceed._

5\. You will be able to provide liquidity as long as you have at least one token available. For example, if user only has PURSE token, some of the PURSE will be converted to BUSD before adding liquidity. User will then have to click _Enable PURSE_ to allow spending of PURSE.

> _There might be extra gas incurred for converting PURSE to BUSD._

6\. If you have both the tokens, input an amount under one of the tokens, the other should be calculated and filled automatically.

> _If you are supplying liquidity for the first time, there will be **Enable PURSE** and **Enable BUSD** buttons. You need to click these two enable buttons to allow spending of both PURSE and BUSD tokens in your wallet._&#x20;

7\. After you have clicked _Supply_, there will be a popup to show the amount of LP Token you will receive. Click _Confirm Supply_ and it will be reflected on the Farm LP Balance shortly after you confirm the transaction in your wallet.

### Harvesting PURSE Rewards

Yield farming will bring you PURSE rewards over time. You could harvest these rewards and use them to either

1. Provides cryptocurrency pair to liquidity pool and get more LP Token
2. Stakes the PURSE in PURSE Staking&#x20;

#### How to Harvest PURSE Rewards?

To harvest your PURSE rewards, you could harvest it directly on the [Farm Menu](https://pursetoken.com/lpfarm/menu) by clicking on the **Harvest** button.

Alternatively

1. Instead of clicking the **Harvest** Button on [Farm Menu](https://pursetoken.com/lpfarm/menu), click the **Select** button to view more details. You should see an estimated of PURSE rewards under _PURSE Earned_.
2. Click the **Harvest** button at top right corner of the pop up. The PURSE will be transferred to you shortly after you confirm the transaction in your wallet.

It's encouraged to harvest **less** frequent so that you could save more on the gas fee. Besides, when you deposit or withdraw, the PURSE rewards will automatically be transferred to your address.
