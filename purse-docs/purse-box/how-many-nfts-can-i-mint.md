# How many NFTs can I mint?

Your `inactiveBalance` shows specifically how many PURSE tokens you have that are not NFTs. This would be akin to your balance of PURSE tokens that are available for conversion into NFTs.

Once you mint one PURSE404 NFT, 1,000,000 PURSE will be deducted from your `inactiveBalance`, but your total balance remains the same. This is because in the contract, it accounts one NFT to be equivalent to 1,000,000 PURSE.

For example:

* Bob starts with 10,000,000 PURSE tokens. Before minting any PURSE BOX NFTs, his `inactiveBalance` is 10,000,000, and his total balance is also 10,000,000.
* Bob decides to mint 1 PURSE BOX NFT, so 1,000,000 PURSE tokens from his `inactiveBalance` will be deducted and converted to 1 PURSE BOX NFT.
* Bob's `inactiveBalance` is now 9,000,000, and he has 1 PURSE BOX NFT. But his total balance remains at 10,000,000.
