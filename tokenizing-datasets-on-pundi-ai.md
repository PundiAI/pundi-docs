# Tokenizing Datasets on Pundi AI

**Tokenizing Datasets on Pundi AI**

The Pundi AI ecosystem introduces a structured token system for datasets, combining access control, authorship rights, and cultural engagement through:

* Ownership Access NFTs: Issued to the dataset creator, confirming authorship and enabling revenue from dataset sales
* Buyer Access NFTs: Issued to buyers, granting permissioned dataset use and DTOK launch rights
* Dataset Tokens (DTOKs): BEP-20 collectibles for community visibility, memes, and on-chain culture

This structure separates real usage from public engagement. Dataset creators earn revenue from dataset sales. Buyers gain access to the data and can also mint DTOKs to reflect community support, attention, or meme value.

***

**Step 1: Upload a Dataset (via Pundi AI Data Marketplace)**

Creators begin by uploading their datasets to the Pundi AI Data Marketplace. These may include labeled data, structured annotations, or any dataset intended for AI training.

* Choose pricing and visibility: public or private
* Provide modalities (text, image, audio), license, language, dataset source, and other details via dataset card
* NFT-based access control is applied automatically

Upon upload, the creator receives an Ownership Access NFT, which proves authorship and allows them to earn revenue from future dataset sales.



**Step 2: Access NFTs for Creators and Buyers**

**Ownership Access NFT is issued to the dataset creator**\
It proves authorship, grants full licensing control, and provides the exclusive right to earn revenue from dataset sales.

**Buyer Access NFT is issued to anyone who purchases the dataset**\
It grants permissioned access to the dataset and allows the holder to launch a DTOK using the Data Pump platform.

**Buyers can use the dataset and participate in launching or trading DTOKs**\
However, they do not receive ownership of the dataset or any rights to revenue or licensing.



**Step 3: Launch a Dataset Token (DTOK) on Data Pump**

Any Access NFT holder, whether creator or buyer, can use the Data Pump platform to launch a Dataset Token (DTOK).

* DTOKs are BEP-20 compatible tokens
* They do not grant dataset access, share revenue, or provide licensing rights
* Their value is based on open market interest, visibility, or meme appeal

DTOKs are designed for visibility and community expression, not for direct data access usage.



**What Each Token Represents**

**What Each Token Does**

**The Ownership Access NFT** is issued to the dataset uploader and proves authorship. It allows the creator to earn revenue when others purchase the dataset.

**The Buyer Access NFT** is given to anyone who buys the dataset. It grants access for usage and also enables the buyer to launch a DTOK.\
\
**The Dataset Token (DTOK)** is a public collectible that can be launched by any Access NFT holder. It does not give access to the dataset and does not affect creator revenue. DTOKs are for community participation and cultural signaling.



**Why Use Dataset Tokens (DTOKs)**

DTOKs offer a new way to participate in the AI data economy. They allow anyone to rally behind a dataset, create visibility around emerging data sources, or trade purely based on social momentum.

Ownership Access NFTs are for permissioned access to datasets.

DTOKs are collectibles that live on-chain.

One is for access. The other is for the culture.
